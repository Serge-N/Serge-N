### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Serge Timothy Nalishiwa here.

Am a Fullstack developer focused on Design Patterns, Beautiful minimalist UI, and Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Preferences
- Primary Language : C#
- Secondary Language : Kotlin
- Cloud Provider : Azure
- UX/UI Tool: Adobe Xd
- IoT : Arduino
- Single Board Computer : PI
- Development OS : macOS

Clearly there is a lot that could be done using only these two langauges, with all these tools and all the related framework, tools and hardware. Am learning all I can at a fast pace but one framework at I time.

Oh, I love coding and would choose any other path in any lifetime.

Outside of work/coding I enjoy :

- :corn: Evaluating agricultural ideas.
- :factory: Implementing construction designs.
- :chart: Learning about investment.
- :video_game: Playing video games.
